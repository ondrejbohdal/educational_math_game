# educational_math_game
The math game is a relatively easy game in which you should put rectangles with given colours and numbers into groups with a given sum.
The game is written in Java and utilizes graphical libraries.

Rules:
At first you choose the level which you want to play.
In each level you have a random number of example, and each example you have three groups with random number of operands.
In each example, you have a set of coloured numbers, which you should put by dragging rectangles with the numbers into several groups with the same sum so that each number in a group has a different colour.
If you realize a mistake, you can put the rectangle away from the group.
You can put a rectangle with a certain colour only at the place with that colour.
When you put all rectangles into the groups, you can check them by clicking on a button used for it.
The final score for the level is calculated as the percentage of correctly filled groups.
If you are the best player in the given level (best score and time score), you will be asked to enter your name into the hall of fame. If you leave it blank, you will be there under none name.
If you are not the best player, you have at least practised solving math problems, and you can try again playing the game.
If you quit the game before the last example in the level, you neither get into the hall of fame nor you see your final result.
